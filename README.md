# Say Hello to "OINKY" - a decentralized social media dApp

In this sample project that I made... I used **Rust** and **Anchor Protocol** on the **Solana** ecosystem.

It's kinda like Twitter but instead of **Tweets**, users will send messages and content as **Oinks**!  :pig_nose:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Here's the full details on my ""OINKY"" dApp project...

* Integrated Solana's **[Phantom](https://phantom.app/)** wallet
* My users will be able to send **oinks** same as like **tweets** (up to 280 characters)
* They can also add an optional "topic" like **Arguments** which is the main concept of this platform..  
My users can vent out their anger (which is so cool!)  :thumbsup:


## Structure of the "OINKY" dApp

To save up on database cost, I used Solana so that users will pay **$SOL** everytime they send **oinks**...  
So in other words, my users will be paying for the database cost and not the owner of the dApp (who is me)..  :clown_face:  
And besides, this platform is mainly for complains, disputes, etc... so **oinks** doesn't have to be as plenty compared to **tweets**


## Programming Languages & Tools

I built the frontend with the use of...

* Vue
* TailwindCSS

For testing I used...

* Mocha
* solana-web.js

And on the backend and database, I used some languages and protocol like

* Rust
* Anchor
* ESLint
* Node

This social media dApp is open to everyone...  
All they need is to have a **Phantom** wallet to log-in to this platform...  
And voila, everyone can send their **oinks**

Here's a sample of accessing the **OINKY** dApp

I didn't go all in on the coding since I am just getting accustomed with **Rust**, **Anchor Protocol**, and **Solana**.  
I do have an option though to deploy this on the Solana devnet, airdropping $SOL on my **Phantom** wallet to test the platform, and also deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.

Let me know your thoughts, because this could be a better solution other than Twitter.   

So until then, let's **Pig Out**   :pig_nose:
